## Abstract

This BRC specifies the three wire forms of the
[BRC-148](brc-148-shard-domain-beef-plane.md)
BEEF object plane: the **multicast object frame** (FrameVer `0x09`, assigned
here), which carries one BEEF-family transaction object on the plane's
domain-tagged shard groups; the **submission record**, the unicast envelope a
publisher sends to operator ingress naming one object to one or more overlay
topics; and the **delivery record**, the unicast envelope a delivery edge
streams to a subscriber. The frame reuses the
[BRC-124](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/BRCs/blob/master/transactions/0124.md)
92-byte header layout at identical offsets, so existing classifiers,
retransmission, and fragmentation infrastructure require no changes. The
records exist because BEEF bytes are not self-delimiting without a full
structural parse — which the fabric never performs — so unlike the
[BRC-143](brc-143-subtree-data.md)/[BRC-144](brc-144-block-frame.md)
push lanes, BEEF lanes carry an explicit length-carrying envelope.

## Motivation

[BRC-148](brc-148-shard-domain-beef-plane.md)
allocates the BEEF object plane (domain `0x1`), defines its topical sharding,
filtering, and coordination, and constrains the header fields that
addressing, retransmission, and filtering depend on — but, following the
convention that frame formats are specified separately from addressing
(BRC-124 vs BRC-129; BRC-143/BRC-144 vs their carriage rules), it defers the
concrete formats to this BRC. This BRC assigns the frame version and fixes
the byte layouts: the fabric frame, and the two unicast record forms that
carry BEEF objects between participants and operator infrastructure.

## Specification

### BEEF object frame (FrameVer `0x09`) — 92-byte header + payload

FrameVer `0x09` is assigned to the BEEF object frame (the next code after
BRC-142's `0x08`).

| Offset | Size | Type | Field | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| 0 | 4 | `uint32` BE | Network Magic | `0xE3E1F3E8` (BSV mainnet P2P magic). Frames with incorrect magic are rejected. |
| 4 | 2 | `uint16` BE | Protocol Version | `0x02BF` (703). Informational; receivers do not validate. |
| 6 | 1 | `byte` | Frame Version | `0x09` — BEEF object frame. Any other value is handled by a different decoder. |
| 7 | 1 | `byte` | DeliverCount | How many of the payload record's leading topics are **deliverable** (matched by delivery edges): `1` from open ingress, up to the operator's cap from authenticated ingress. `0` is the legacy encoding and is read as `1`. Every further name in the record is a **label**: carried to the subscriber, never matched. Set by the ingress, never taken from a publisher's pre-framed value. The BEEF encoding version is **not** here — it is the object's first four bytes. |
| 8 | 32 | `[32]byte` | ContentID | `SHA-256d(payload bytes)` — the object's identity, over the payload as carried (the submission record when the ingress carried one, so the same object under a different label set is a distinct submission); and the BRC-130 reassembly verification hash. With TopicID it keys both fragment reassembly and duplicate suppression (see below). Never the subject TxID. |
| 40 | 8 | `uint64` BE | HashKey | Per-(sender, group) flow identifier; stamped at ingress; `0` = unset. Derivation and flow semantics per [BRC-148](brc-148-shard-domain-beef-plane.md) §Frame carriage (TopicID excluded). |
| 48 | 8 | `uint64` BE | SeqNum | Per-sender monotonic counter within the (sender, group) flow; stamped at ingress; `0` = unstamped. Drives gap detection, NACK recovery, and retransmit dedup. |
| 56 | 32 | `[32]byte` | TopicID | `SHA-256(UTF-8 topic name)` of the record's **first** topic. The shard key: group derivation takes its top bits, and it is always the first deliverable topic. Occupies the field that carries the SubtreeID in transaction frames. |
| 88 | 4 | `uint32` BE | Payload Length | Byte length of the payload. |
| 92 | \* | `[]byte` | Payload | The **submission record verbatim** (leads with the `0xBEEF` tag; every topic name the publisher submitted, then the object, proof data intact), or a bare BEEF object (leads with `0x01`). The two cannot collide on their leading bytes. |

#### Object leading bytes — BEEF version word

The object is the record's `Object` field, or the whole payload when the
payload is a bare object.

| Object `[0:4]` | Type | Encoding | Reference |
| --------------- | ---- | -------- | --------- |
| `0100BEEF` | `uint32` LE (4022206465) | BEEF | [BRC-62](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/BRCs/blob/master/transactions/0062.md) |
| `0200BEEF` | `uint32` LE (4022206466) | BEEF V2 (TXID-only extension) | [BRC-96](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/BRCs/blob/master/transactions/0096.md) |
| `01010101` | 4-byte prefix (32-byte subject TxID follows) | Atomic BEEF | [BRC-95](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/BRCs/blob/master/transactions/0095.md) |

The version word is the BRC-148 version filter's input — an
encoding-capability gate only, never an overlay namespace. Intentionally
absent from the header: the subject TxID (consumer-level semantics inside
the payload) and any per-format sub-type byte (the marker is
self-identifying at a fixed offset).

#### Fragmentation

Objects exceeding the path MTU are carried as
[BRC-130](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/BRCs/blob/master/transactions/0130.md)
fragments (`FrameVer 0x03`, `OrigFrameVer = 0x09`) with bytes 0–91
layout-identical to the table above, so ContentID, TopicID and DeliverCount
appear in every fragment; ContentID is the reassembly verification hash.
Reassembly MUST key slots on the (ContentID, TopicID) pair. The record's
field order puts the topic list before the object, so fragment 0 carries
the whole list and an edge may discard a non-matching object before
reassembling it; that order is fixed for this reason. The interaction with
filtering is specified in BRC-148 §Frame carriage.

### Submission record (ingress)

A publisher submits the pair *(topic list, BEEF object)* as one record:

```text
Offset  Size  Field
  0       2   Tag         (uint16 BE = 0xBEEF — record discriminator on shared ports)
  2       1   RecordVer   (0x01)
  3       1   TopicCount  (1..15)
  4       …   Topics      (TopicCount × { uint8 NameLen (1..64) ∥ NameLen bytes UTF-8 topic name })
  …       4   ObjectLen   (uint32 BE, ≥ 1; operators bound the maximum accepted size)
  …       …   Object      (the BEEF object; leading marker per the version-word table)
```

The ingress emits the record as **one** `FrameVer 0x09` frame at any topic
count: the payload is the record verbatim, `TopicID = SHA-256(topics[0])`,
ContentID is over the record, and the frame goes to the first topic's
group. Ingress duplicate suppression keys on the (ContentID, TopicID) pair
per BRC-148. A record whose object does not lead with a marker from the
version-word table, whose lengths violate the bounds above, or whose object
exceeds the operator's size bound MUST be rejected. A malformed record
desynchronises its stream; the receiver MUST close the connection.

#### Deliverable topics and labels

A record names 1..15 topics on every path and is never rejected for its
count. What the ingress path decides is how many of the leading names are
**deliverable** — matched by delivery edges against subscribers' elections
— and it writes that number into `DeliverCount`. Every further name is a
**label**: it reaches every subscriber the object reaches, inside the
payload, and is never matched on, so a subscriber electing only a label
topic does not receive the object.

- **Open / public / anonymous ingress** (a record admitted on a public port
  with no consumer identity) MUST set `DeliverCount = 1`. One deliverable
  topic per anonymous record is what keeps the free door free of
  amplification: a record costs one frame and reaches one topic's
  subscribers however many names it carries, so there is no
  attacker-declarable fan-out on a path with no proof-of-work or membership
  lever to bound it.
- **Authenticated / consumer-tunnel ingress** MAY set `DeliverCount` up to
  the operator's cap, which is at most 15 and is operator policy. The
  operator's fan-out exposure is bounded by that cap, not by `TopicCount`.

`DeliverCount` is the ingress's to set. An ingress accepting a pre-framed
`FrameVer 0x09` MUST overwrite it from its own policy for that source, and
MUST reject a pre-framed record whose header TopicID is not the hash of its
first topic. There is no per-topic charge on either path: nothing beyond
the deliverable prefix is delivered, so nothing beyond it is priced, and a
subscriber's cost stays what its lane carried.

A subscriber that elected more than one of a frame's deliverable topics
receives the object **once**, under the first elected topic in record
order; the delivery record below names that topic.

This split is a policy over an unchanged wire grammar — the 92-byte frame
and the record layout are byte-identical on both paths; only the value the
ingress writes into `DeliverCount` differs.

#### Detection on shared ports

BEEF submission records MAY ride the open transaction port alongside the
existing grammars, distinguished by leading
bytes — network magic `0xE3E1F3E8` selects a framed datagram, the `0xBEEF`
tag selects a submission record, and anything else is a bare transaction
([BRC-12](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/BRCs/blob/master/transactions/0012.md)
raw / [BRC-30](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/BRCs/blob/master/transactions/0030.md)
Extended Format, whose little-endian version byte at offset 1 is `0x00` —
the three forms cannot collide). Over TCP the grammar is committed once per
connection; over UDP it is detected per datagram, and a record must fit one
datagram (larger objects submit over a stream transport). Operators MAY
additionally expose a dedicated single-record-grammar port for flow
separation; it carries no additional admission semantics.

### Delivery record (egress)

A delivery edge streaming BEEF objects to a subscriber over a unicast lane
emits, per delivered object:

```text
Offset  Size  Field
  0      32   TopicID     (the identifier of the elected topic that matched)
 32       4   PayloadLen  (uint32 BE, ≥ 1)
 36       …   Payload     (the frame payload verbatim: the submission record, or a bare object)
```

The TopicID is the one of the subscriber's elected topics that the edge
matched, which need not be the frame's header TopicID. The payload is the
frame payload verbatim, so when the publisher submitted a record the
subscriber receives every topic name it wrote, deliverable and label alike,
and can map the matched identifier back to one of them; a subscriber that
receives a bare object maps the identifier back from its own election.
The subscriber tells the two forms apart by the payload's leading bytes
exactly as the frame does. Subscribers taking whole `FrameVer 0x09` frames
instead of a stripped lane need no record; the frame already carries the
identifiers and the payload.
